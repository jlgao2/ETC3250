## Answers to week's tutorial questions

## 1a
R is a programming language designed to work with data by making it easy to manuplate and store data, having handy operators and ecosystem of community libraries as well as powerful graphical output capability.  

## 1b
The R project started in August 1993

## 1c
Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland

## 1d
The R project built on top of the base 'S' language

## 1e
Hadley Wickham says that R is a great place to start your data science journey because it is an environment designed from the ground up to support data science. R is not just a programming language, but it is also an interactive environment for doing data science.

## 1f
CRAN is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R. Please use the CRAN mirror nearest to you to minimize network load. 

## 1g 
Alternatives for R for similar data sciency workflows include Python and Julia, other tools like SPSS, Stata, eViews, Matlab

## 2a
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management. Intergrated developmetn environment is a place where you can write code and test it with other potential ease of use features

## 2b
R is the language, and R studio is the environment in which you write in that language. Using the aeroplane analogy the language is the thing that flies the IDE is the thing that interfaces you to the aeroplane.

## 2c
R is a better skillset, learning functions and frameworks is probably more useful than learning like where the boxes and buttons are. 

## 2d
A public benefit company is a corporation that includes in its charter a purpose for the public benefit as well as profit. It will mean for the user that the company is trying to help fulfill your needs rather than just juicing you for your ca$h

## 3a
    Write a sentence explaining why YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WORK IN A PROJECT FOR THIS CLASS 😄. Each time you start RStudio for this class, be sure to open this project.
    
    Using R projects allow you to neatly delineate different actual projects you're working on with their directories, dependancies and files 
    
## 3b
    What file is created in your file system/directory when you create a project? How can this be used to restart RStudio?
    
    An .rproj file
## 3c
    In your RStudio settings, set the default to be “Never save the workspace”. Why do this?
    
    To encourage reproducibility - your code will hopefully always generate the same output with this practice
## 3d    
    Which of these is a “working directory”?
        this one -> sentence (i): where R looks for files that you ask it to load
        sentence (ii): the home folder on your computer


## 4a

the cheatsheet for rmarkdown is located at https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf
## 4b

The files generated by the knit are output into the working directory
## 4c

done :)
## 4d

```{r echo = TRUE}
x <- c(1.2, -0.5, 2.9, 3.2, 0.1, 2.2)
# Find Mean.
result.mean <- mean(x)
print(result.mean)
```
## 4e
lets try an equation - for any series X

$$ \bar X =  \frac{\sum X}{N}  $$

## 5a

```{r echo = TRUE}
(100+2)/3
5*10^2
1/0
0/0
(0i-9)^(1/2)
sqrt(-2*max(-10,0.2,4.5)+100)
```

## 5b

```{r echo = TRUE}
mode <- function(x){
    uniqx <- unique(x)
    uniqx[which.max(tabulate(match(x, uniqx)))]
}
y <- c(1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 9, 4, 4, 8)
mode(y)
```
## 6a
We can install a R package by using the command 
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('package name')
```
## 6b 
The library() command loads a package into memory to allow for faster execution

## 6c
You install a package and re-run it as often as you get an intuitive feel for in order to take advantage of the latest updates to that package. 

## 6d
```{r}
install.packages('ISLR')
```
## 7a
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data(economics, package = "ggplot2")
# data frames are essentially a list of vectors
glimpse(economics)
```
There are 574 obersations in the economic data

## 7b
```{r}
library(gapminder)
glimpse(gapminder)
```
There are 6 variables in the gapminder data: Country, Continent, Year, Life expectancy, Population, and GDP per capita

## 7c
```{r}
candy <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv")
glimpse(candy)
sum(is.na(candy))
```
There appears to be no missing values in this data

## 8
```{r}
pisa <- readRDS("~/R/ETC3250/student_sub.rds")
glimpse(pisa)
pisa$CNT
aus_qcn = filter(pisa, CNT == "AUS"| CNT =="QCN")
sd_aq = sqrt(var(aus_qcn$PV1READ))
mean_aq = mean(aus_qcn$PV1READ)
print(sd_aq)
print(mean_aq)
```
