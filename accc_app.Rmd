## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(seasonal)
accc_data = read_csv('data/accc_data.csv')

rvr <- accc_data  %>% mutate(Date = dmy(Date)) %>% arrange(Date) %>% seas()


ac_plot <- ggplot(rvr, aes(x=Date, y=price, fill = as.factor(Qtr))) + 
  geom_col()  + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Spectral") +
  xlab("Quarter Ending") + 
  ylab("Average daily weighted imbalance price ($ per gigajoule)") +
  labs(fill = "Quarter")

ggsave('ac_plot.png', width = 12, height = 9)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
